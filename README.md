## grlic: glass-like random catalogues for cosmological light cones

## Description

grlic is a python tool which produces glass-like random catalogues with a specified radially-dependent number density distribution. Such catalogues can be used for precise estimates of N-point correlation functions of tracers on the backward light cone. The Landy-Szalay estimator of the two-point correlation function using these glass-like catalogues is unbiased and has much lower variance than the estimator using Poisson-sampled random catalogues.

## Requirements

grlic needs the following python packages:

 - Pylians3: https://pylians3.readthedocs.io/en/master/construction.html
 - numpy
 - scipy
 
## Installation

In the current version, grlic can simply be run by cloning the repository and running:

python main.py

from inside the src directory.

This will create a glass-like random catalogue according to the settings specified in settings.py.

## Usage
